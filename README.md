roncli.com
==========

This is the source repository for the [roncli.com](http://www.roncli.com) website.  This website is written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org) using the [rendr](https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr) library.

Projects
========

There are two parts to the roncli.com project.

The first is the SQL Server database, which is encapsulated in a Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools 2013 project.

The second is the Node project itself, which is developed via PhpStorm.  I do have a Visual Studio Node.js Tools project setup in the solution, but unfortunately Node.js Tools is really buggy right now, and the JavaScript editor is really clunky compared to PhpStorm.  I do not guarantee that the Visual Studio Node.js Tools project will be up to date, except for releases.

Libraries
=========

Where possible, the loading of all third party libraries is left as an exercise to the user.

The following libraries are currently preloaded as part of the project:
* JQuery
