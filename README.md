roncli.com
==========

This is the source repository for the [roncli.com](http://www.roncli.com) website.  This website is written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org) using the [rendr](https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr) library.

Projects
========

There are two parts to the roncli.com project.

The first is the SQL Server database, which is encapsulated in a Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools 2013 project.

The second is the Node project itself, which is developed via PhpStorm.  I do have a Visual Studio Node.js Tools project setup in the solution, but unfortunately Node.js Tools is really buggy right now, and the JavaScript editor is really clunky compared to PhpStorm.  I do not guarantee that the Visual Studio Node.js Tools project will be up to date, except for releases.

Requirements
============

Be sure to have Visual Studio 2013,  and node.js 0.10.28 or later installed with npm.

Database Setup
==============

To setup the database, make sure you have Microsoft SQL Server installed.  I use 2014, but I imagine any version will work.

1. Create an empty database.
2. Open the Visual Studio solution and do a schema comparison against the database using your admin account.
3. Right click on the database project and do a Schema Comparison.
4. Press the Compare button to start the comparison.
5. Press the Update button to update the database with the schema from the database.

Windows Installation
====================

To run the website on Windows, make sure you perform the following steps.

1. Install [Visual Studio 2013 Express](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/E/72E0F986-D247-4289-B9DC-C4FB07374894/wdexpress_full.exe) if you do not already have Visual Studio 2013 installed.
2. Install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Download the all-in-one bundle for [GTK+ 2.x x86](http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php) or [GTK+ 2.x x64](http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php).
4. Unzip the GTK+ 2.x directory to c:\GTK.  It is important that the files are in this directory, as that is where the canvas npm package will be looking for it.
5. Add the c:\GTK\bin\ directory to your system PATH.  (This may require a restart.)
6. From an admin command prompt, install node-gyp and grunt-cli globally:

        npm install -g node-gyp grunt-cli

7. Install the node modules from the /roncli.com directory:

        npm install -msvs_version=2013

    If this step fails, you're going to have to get your hands dirty!  Perform the following steps:
    - Rerun the command with the -f flag:
    
            npm install -msvs_version=2013 -f

    - Using a text editor, open /roncli.com/node_modules/captchagen/node_modeules/canvas/src/CanvasRenderingContext2d.cc and add the line following line in the includes section at the top after the include to vector:

            #include <algorithm>

    - From the /roncli.com/node_modules/captchagen directory, rebuild the canvas module:
    
            npm rebuild canvas -msvs_version=2013 -f

    These extra steps are temporary until the canvas module publishes this fix and the captchagen library moves to this version of the canvas library.
8. Add /roncli.com/server/privateConfig.js with the following data:

        module.exports = {
            twitter: {
                consumer_key: "(Your Twitter API key)",
                consumer_secret: "(Your Twitter API secret)",
                access_token_key: "(Your Twitter access token key)",
                access_token_secret: "(Your Twitter access token secret)"
            },
            database: {
				server: "(Your SQL Server hostname)",
				port: (Your SQL Server port),
				user: "(Your SQL Server login name)",
				password: "(Your SQL Server login password)",
				database: "(Your SQL Server database name)",
				pool: {
					min: 0,
					max: 50,
					idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
				}
            },
            smtp: {
                host: "(Your SMTP server hostname)"
            }
        };

9. If using [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode), point an IIS application to the inner /roncli.com directory.  Otherwise, run using a standalone installation from the command line by running /roncli.com/run.bat.

Other Installations
===================

1. The roncli.com website requires the [Cairo](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki) library to be installed.  Make sure you follow the Cairo installation instructions for your operating system.
2. From an admin command prompt, install grunt-cli globally:

        npm install -g grunt-cli

3. Install the node modules from the /roncli.com directory:

        npm install

4. Add /roncli.com/server/privateConfig.js with the following data:

        module.exports = {
            twitter: {
                consumer_key: "(Your Twitter API key)",
                consumer_secret: "(Your Twitter API secret)",
                access_token_key: "(Your Twitter access token key)",
                access_token_secret: "(Your Twitter access token secret)"
            },
            database: {
				server: "(Your SQL Server hostname)",
				port: (Your SQL Server port),
				user: "(Your SQL Server login name)",
				password: "(Your SQL Server login password)",
				database: "(Your SQL Server database name)",
				pool: {
					min: 0,
					max: 50,
					idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
				}
            },
            smtp: {
                host: "(Your SMTP server hostname)"
            }
        };

5. Run /roncli.com/run.bat to start the web server.  Alternatively, you can run the following commands instead:

        grunt
        node index.js
