roncli.com
==========

This is the source repository for the [roncli.com](http://www.roncli.com) website.  This website is written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org) using the [rendr](https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr) library.

Projects
========

There are two parts to the roncli.com project.

The first is the SQL Server database, which is encapsulated in a Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools 2013 project.

The second is the Node project itself, which is developed via PhpStorm.  I do have a Visual Studio Node.js Tools project setup in the solution, but unfortunately Node.js Tools is really buggy right now, and the JavaScript editor is really clunky compared to PhpStorm.  I do not guarantee that the Visual Studio Node.js Tools project will be up to date, except for releases.

Requirements
============

Be sure to have Visual Studio 2013, and node.js 0.10.28 or later installed with npm.

Windows Installation
====================

To run the website itself, make sure you perform the following steps. (NOTE: THESE ARE NOT WORKING.)

1. Install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the all-in-one bundle for [GTK+ 2.x](http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php).
3. Unzip the GTK+ 2.x directory to c:\GTK.
4. Add the c:\GTK\bin directory to your system PATH.  (This may require a restart.)
5. From the GTK+ 2.x /bin directory, configure the GTK+ 2.x package:

        pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0

6. From an admin command prompt, install node-gyp globally:

        npm install -g node-gyp

7. Install the node modules from the roncli.com directory:

        npm install -msvs_version=2013
